# Netze -- C++ socket to perform actuations on embedded devices.

This project aims use of embedded devices remotely,using Sockets for comunication between Application and device,  in order to make the device transparent to the application , making it easy to implement and expanding the possibilities of development .

TODO LIST
1 - Create Socket server
  1.1 - Connect in Socket server -        ok
  1.2 - Define port to connect  -         ok
  1.3 - Pass and receive params to embedded board - ok 
  

2 - Create server Client --> Not for now 
  
3 - access Gpios 
  3.1 - Define board with tests, maybe using proper GPIO, read the value, and assign board. -- in implementation
    

4 - Perform actuations in Gpio's pin's
5 - Read Values from Gpio pin
6 - Learning English ^^
7 - Threads process
